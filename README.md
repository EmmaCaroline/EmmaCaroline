## Hi there 👋

I'm a **Front-End Developer student** who enjoys every opportunity to learn something new.  

:mountain_snow: Based in Vestfold, Norway  

:seedling: I'm currently sharpening my frontend skills and expanding into backend development with Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), and PostgreSQL, building on my existing experience with MySQL — aiming to become a fullstack developer.
